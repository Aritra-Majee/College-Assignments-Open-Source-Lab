Simple Calculator in C
Overview
This is a simple calculator program written in C that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Code Structure
Headers & Function Declarations:
Includes <stdio.h> and declares all functions at the top for clarity.

main() Function:
Controls the program flow with a loop displaying the menu, taking user input, calling arithmetic functions, and handling errors (e.g., division by zero).

menu() Function:
Displays the calculator options.

Arithmetic Functions:
Separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Functions Documentation
Function	Description	Input Parameters	Returns
menu()	Displays calculator menu options	None	None (prints menu)
add(a, b)	Returns sum of two integers	int a, int b	int (sum of a and b)
subtract(a,b)	Returns difference of two integers	int a, int b	int (difference a - b)
multiply(a,b)	Returns product of two integers	int a, int b	int (product a * b)
divide(a,b)	Returns quotient as a float, checks division by zero	int a, int b	float (quotient a / b)

How It Works
Program starts in main().

The menu is displayed using menu().

User selects an operation (1-5).

For operations 1-4, user inputs two integers.

The corresponding arithmetic function is called:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication — perform integer math.

Division — checks if divisor is zero to prevent errors.

The result is printed.

The loop repeats until user selects Exit (5).
